This is the project for statistical analysis of the High Intensity Interval Training induced Adaptations to Aerobic Capacity and Fatigue in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Trend Toward IFN-1 Dependence â€“ A Randomized Controlled Single-center Clinical Trial.   (nicknamed LUPEX for Lupus & Exercise) by Malte Lund Adamsen et al.

Much of the data is kept with Danish and English intertwined, as such, a non-Danish speaking reader would benefit immensely from having a translator ready or running it through a LLM for translating.

If you want to run this project, the scripts should be run in the following order:
	0. 	OPEN THE PROJECT - StatistikLupex.Rproj - Else the Here() function wont work.
	1. 	DataWrangling.qmd
	2. 	VO2maxdata.qmd
	3. 	Questionnaires.qmd
	4. 	SLEDAI_Analysis.qmd
	5. 	CytokineScoreModel.qmd
	6.  	Analysis_of_ActivityMeasures.qmd (not ActivityMeasures.qmd, that is mainly for generating the data from the accelerometer files)
	7.  	DifferentialExpression.qmd
	8.  	OtherExploratoryOutcomes.qmd
	9.  	ModelAggregation.qmd
	10.	TablesRUs.qmd

This project encompassess the following subfolders:

~Main/
	Readme.txt - This file
	StatistikLupex.Rproj - Start by opening this.

	~/Code/
		_targets.R - Deprecated, old code, decided not to use targets for this project. Although I probably should have.
		ActivityMeasures.qmd - The GGIR based code for extracting information from the accelerometer.
		Analysis_of_ActivityMeasures.qmd - The linear mixed models for analysing the activity measures 
		BloodSamplesAnalysis.qmd
		CytoKineScoreModel.qmd            
		DataWrangling.qmd
		DataWrangling_Genes_Deprecated.qmd
		DietAnalysis.qmd
		DifferentialExpression.qmd
		ModelAggregation.qmd
		OtherExploratoryOutcomes.qmd
		Questionnaires.qmd
		renv.lock - The renv lock file
		SampleData for Help.qmd
		SimulatedData.qmd
		SLEDAI_Analysis.qmd
		Transcriptomics.qmd

		~/R/          
			functions.R                      
		~/renv/
		~/Verisense-Toolbox-master/


~/Data/
	~/Old_Data/ - Contains older compilations of the raw data with various flaws. 

~/Documents/

~/Output/ - Contains most of the output from running the code, but is also used as intermediate storage between the documents so the code can be run in smaller chunks.

~/Input/
	~ SF36USPOPMEANSD.xslx - Means and SD for US population for normalizing the SF-36
